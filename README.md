# Task:
To build a tic-tac-toe web application, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By implementing functions to handle user clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions, you can create an interactive and engaging tic-tac-toe game. With these technologies and functionalities, users can play against each other or against an AI opponent, aiming to get three markers in a row to win the game.

# Learnings from the Project:
HTML:
Forms with Labels:

Implementation of forms with corresponding labels for improved accessibility.
Dropdown for Player Type:

Utilization of the select element within forms to create a dropdown menu for switching player types.
Buttons for Tic Tac Toe Blocks:

Deployment of buttons to represent individual blocks within the Tic Tac Toe grid.
Hidden Buttons for Game Control:

Incorporation of buttons initially hidden from view, responsible for resetting the game and declaring the winner. These buttons become visible only upon game completion.
CSS:
Container Layout:

Structuring of the game layout using CSS, featuring a main container div with dimensions set at 60 units to accommodate a 3x3 grid of buttons.
Flipping Animation:

Utilization of the transform property, specifically rotateY(180deg), to apply a flipping animation to buttons with the .clicked class. The animation effect is facilitated through a transition specified in the main class.
Inline Block Display:

Setting the display property to inline-block for proper width management and application of other CSS properties within the inline block restriction.
Hide Class:

Creation of a .hide class with the display: none property to conceal elements initially. This class is later removed to make buttons visible.
